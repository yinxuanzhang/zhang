## License

I chose the MIT License for this project because it is a permissive open-source license that allows others to freely use, modify, and distribute my code, as long as they include the original license in any copies or substantial portions of the software. The MIT License encourages collaboration and sharing while protecting my rights as the original author. This flexibility makes it ideal for open-source projects and allows my work to be used in both personal and commercial applications without many restrictions.
